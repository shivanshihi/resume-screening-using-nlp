# Ethical AI Hiring Assistant 🚀

An AI-powered recruitment platform designed to streamline resume screening while promoting fairness, transparency, and responsible decision-making in hiring.

Built using Natural Language Processing (NLP), the system evaluates candidate resumes against job descriptions, generates match scores, provides explainable insights, and delivers real-time analytics for HR teams.

## 🌟 Problem Statement

Traditional recruitment is time-consuming and often influenced by unconscious bias. Recruiters must manually review hundreds of resumes, which can lead to missed talent and inconsistent hiring decisions.

There is a growing need for intelligent systems that **augment human recruiters** rather than replace them — improving efficiency while maintaining ethical responsibility.

✔ Screens resumes automatically
✔ Calculates semantic match scores
✔ Highlights relevant skills
✔ Provides explainable hiring recommendations
✔ Offers an analytics dashboard for HR
✔ Supports fair and transparent recruitment

Our goal is to combine **AI intelligence with human judgment**, enabling smarter hiring workflows.
